						<p>After moving to the U.S. I started going to my new school called Franklin School and later proceeded to go to Kearny High school.
							Kearny is and will always be my hometown and I have many wonderful memories growing up.  While attending school I continued to
							have an interest in Math classes with the exeption of a few history classes.  I was able to meet people 
							from different parts of the world and got to know more about their culture.  I have met people from Brazil, Mexico, Portugal, Poland,
							China, India, and other parts of Africa.  It's been a true experience meeting so many different people from different parts of the world and I
							have seen how each of us play a significant role in our society.  We work together in order to become a better person but most important 
							find ways to work together as a team.</p
