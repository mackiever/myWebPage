						<p>At a very young age my father bought me my very first computer where I was able to explore the amazing place the internet was becoming and soon
							change the way I saw the world.  I still remember connecting to the internet through a dial-up connection and everything running 
							very slow.  I was involved with a very particular strategy game called StarCraft where I really began wondering how such a game could
							be developed with the help of a programming language.  From then on I had already grown an interest in software with a little
							help from the math classes which I enjoyed very much.  Before applying to colleges I already knew that a Computer Science degree 
							would be the best choice for me.  I can see now that the world is changing very fast and with the help of software design many
							more things are to come in the near future.</p
