	<h1>Education</h1>
	<p>I attended both Rutgers University and New Jersey Institute of Technology and received my diploma from both Universities.
		I have obtained a B.A. in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics.  If you click on the "Rutgers/NJIT classes" link you'll see a few classes which I took at both
		universities.</p>

	<h1>Experience</h1>
	<p>Internship: I was part of a group of 5 students where we were distributed differents tasks throughout one semester.  Two of us were responsible for working with a 
		database system which was hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) with the help of PostgreSQL.  Our goal was to collect public records from each municipality located
		in New Jersey.  We proceeded to clean up the CSV files which needed to be organized before importing to database.  Some columns did not have the correct
		information and other columns were unorganized.  Most importantly, we needed to make our database easier to access with the help of queries specifically
		designed to gather information the most efficient way possible.  Finally, display data on website according to user's input.</p>

	<h1>Future-Plan</h1>
	<p>I'm currently taking the necessary steps to become a better programmer.  I have picked up Java Script and PHP as two new languages and my goal is
		to spend more time on either the front-end working with javascript or back-end and get exposed to php and mysql.  I'd also like to return to 
		programming in Java and possibly design small applications that I could use for a future project.  Other languages are also on my list
		and sincerely I'd like to get exposed to as many languages as I possibly can.  Fortunately, there is always something new to learn.</p>
